# **Pipeline Tools and Objectives**

## **1. Git**
- **Objective:**  
  Manage source code versions and track changes efficiently, enabling Jenkins to pull the latest code for the pipeline.

## **2. SonarQube**
- **Objective:**  
  Analyze code quality, detect technical debt, and enforce quality gates to ensure maintainable and robust code.

## **3. JaCoCo**
- **Objective:**  
  Measure code coverage for Java applications and generate detailed reports to identify untested parts of the codebase.

## **4. Lizard**
- **Objective:**  
  Calculate and report cyclomatic complexity, helping identify overly complex code that may need refactoring.

## **5. OWASP Dependency-Check**
- **Objective:**  
  Scan project dependencies for known security vulnerabilities and generate reports to mitigate potential risks.

## **6. Email Extension Plugin**
- **Objective:**  
  Send email notifications about build status to stakeholders, keeping them informed about pipeline outcomes.

## **7. Slack**
- **Objective:**  
  Notify teams in real-time about build success or failure through a dedicated communication channel.
